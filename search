##### Hypothesis:

Organic Light Emitting Devices (OLEDs) are presented with particular emphasis on
materials, device structures and strategies to improve light extraction. For the
fabrication of efficient OLEDs, two types of electroluminescent materials are used
(small molecules and polymers) with efficiencies and lifetimes which are now acceptable
for small size or low content information displays. Two main approaches are described to
enhance external efficiency, one is based on direct modification of the species emission
and the other on modification of emitted guided modes propagation within the device.
The features of the different approaches are evidenced through examples of devices reported in the literature.


##### Experimets:

The emissive and conductive layers are made of special organic molecules that conduct electricity.
The anode and cathode connect the OLED to the source of electricity.
When electricity is applied to an OLED, the emissive layer becomes 
negatively charged and the conductive layer becomes positively charged.
Electrostatic forces cause electrons to move from the positive conductive 
layer toward the negative emissive layer. This causes a change in the electrical
levels and makes radiation that has a frequency in the range of visible light.
OLED, as with all diodes, can only work if electricity flows through them in 
the correct direction. The Anode, connected to the emmisive layer must be at a
higher electrical potential (more volts, more positive) than the cathode, connected to the conductive layer, for the OLED to work.

##### Conclusion

In summary, we have described materials and OLED device performances showing  that the technology
is now mature for industrial applications like advanced displays  or solid-state lighting.
Highly efficient devices can be obtained by using phosphorescent materials with nearly 100% internal
quantum efficiency. Lifetimes of commercial products (music players, displays for mobile phone) are
typically rated at  10,000–20,000 h. However, larger display panels for TV sets seem to be still many
years away. The key issue of light trapping in the planar OLED structure has been discussed through the
description of strategies investigated to improve light extraction. The employed strategies have been
classified into two main approaches: the extraction improvement by means of  •  a direct modification
of the material emission  •  a modification of the emitted light propagation in the OLED structure.

### Use of Ethernet Technology in Computer Network

#### Answers:

##### Hypothesis:
Ethernet is introduced as one of the
oldest but still the largest form of technology being
used for networking. For many years, Ethernet has
proven itself as a very popular, fast and relatively
inexpensive LAN technology.
Actually, it would be difficult to think of the
presence of computer network without Ethernet. So
keeping the immense relevance of Ethernet in mind,

##### Experimets:

Ethernet works by linking computers and other
devices using cables. One end of the Ethernet cable is
connected to the computer whereas the other is
connected to a connector such as repeater, hub and
switch. As far as sending signal is concerned, Ethernet
basically works by chain reactions. One computer
generates and sends a signal of its desired action. The
signal passes through the cables, and then through the
connector, then to cables again and finally to their
designated receiving computer. Also, Ethernet uses an
algorithm based on random delay times to determine
the proper waiting period between retransmission. In
traditional Ethernet, the protocol for broadcasting,

##### Conclusion

Ethernet is a protocol that controls the way data
is transmitted over a local area network (LAN). 
Ether, meaning “light bearing”, stands for the use of light as a means of data carrying
medium whereas Net is a short form of network that
means the community or a group of linked computers. It
is not a wireless technology because it uses physical
media generally called wires. Predominantly, Ethernet
specifications define low level data transmission
protocols

##### Hypothesis:

Nearly all measurements in physical chemistry
are currently based on the conversion of the quantities to be measured into electric current or voltage,
which is usually recorded on a sh

##### Experimets:

The scattered electron intensities recorded on a
photographic plate were measured by a microphotometer (Rigaku Denki MP3),2). The electric current from a photomultiplier
(RCA 931A), about 0.1μA, was grounded through
a high-precision resistor of 10 MΩ installed in an
integrating digital voltmeter (Takeda Riken TR65A15, 10 kc per volt); hence, no pre-amplifier
was necessary. The output voltage, read out in
five significant decimal digits, was recorded by a
digital printer (TR-6191). The basic conditions
for the measurement were adjusted in the following
way. The detector system was found to have
sufficient precision and stability for carrying out
the required tests.
a) Dark Current. When no incident light was
present and the d. c. voltage of 320 V, was applied
to the photomultiplier, the photocurrent was about
1.5×10-9A, and no appreciable irregular fluctuation was observed during the measurement.
b) Optical System. It was possible to obtain
an optical source of sufficient stability and linearity
by supplying a lamp with a d. c. current of about
2.5 A from a pair of two 6-V batteries (108 A hr)
connected in parallel. The brightness of the
light decreased with time in the ratio of about
3×10-5per minute.
c) Photoelectric Stability. The random noises
in the photocurrent with periods of more than a
few tenths of a cycle per second can be rejected
by an integrating measurement with a gate time
of a few seconds. The photomultiplier was used
with a lowered sensitivity with a d. c. voltage of
about 320 V across Electrodes 9 and 11 of the
931A tube. Care was taken to stabilize this d. c.

##### Conclusion

a) In comparison with analogue measurements, errors from
various electric sources (random noises generated
in amplification, transmission, etc.) and mechanical
sources (friction in pen recording, uncertainties
in the chart scale, etc.) can be decreased or eliminated.
b) The measurements can not only be made
more easily and rapidly, but also the outputs can
be used more directly as input data to an electronic
computer for a subsequent data analysis.
c) The measurements can be made much more
precisely, since the readings can he integrated for
an arbitrary length of time, or the results of several
repeated scannings can be superimposed. This
procedure improves the signal-to-noise ratio appreciably.
The present note will report on the application
of the above technique to the microdensitometry
of electron-diffraction photographs.1)
